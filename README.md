# Hi, I'm Rajaa Shaaban 👋

🎓 I'm a Computer Science graduate with a growing passion for web development, problem-solving, and building real-world projects.

🌱 Currently building my GitHub portfolio while learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — and exploring other tools like React and Python.

📌 I recently built a simple [Weather App](link-to-your-project) using HTML/CSS/JS and I'm working on more personal projects to sharpen my skills.

💼 I'm currently seeking internship opportunities (remote or in-person) where I can grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects.

🗣️ I speak English, Arabic, French, and conversational Korean — and I'm always up for collaborating and learning with others.
