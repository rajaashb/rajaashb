# Hi, I'm Rajaa Shaaban 👋

I'm a Computer Science graduate passionate about building real-world projects and solving problems through code. While I have a strong foundation in web development, I've recently been diving into data science, focusing on Python, data analysis, and storytelling with data.



**🧠 What I'm Working On**

- Data Science Projects: Completed an in-depth analysis of app profiles on Google Play and the App Store to identify profitable app genres.

- Web Development: Continuing to enhance my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and exploring frameworks like React.

- Learning: Expanding my knowledge in Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.



**📂 Featured Project**

- App Profile Analysis: Analyzed datasets from Google Play and the App Store to determine which app genres are most successful. This project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and deriving actionable insights.
